1. Firstly you will need to clone this repository by running the ```git clone <project's Github URL>``` command

2. After you've that you'll need to make sure that you have **npm** and **bower** installed
  
  2.1 You can get **npm** by installing Node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  
  2.2 Once you've done this you'll need to run the following command:
     `npm install -g bower # this may require sudo on Mac/Linux`

3. Once **npm** and **bower** are installed, you'll need to install all of the dependencies in *package.json* and *bower.json*
  ```
  npm install
 
  bower install
  ```

4. After those dependencies have been installed you'll need to make sure that you have **http-server** installed. You can install this by running the following: ```npm install -g http-server # this also may require sudo on Mac/Linux```

5. Once **http-server** is installed run ```http-server -c-1```

6. The project will now run on [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
